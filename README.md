# Spherical-robot-machine-vision

* The spherical robot is a `reconnaissance robot`, so it needs to have a strong environment perception capability. The spherical robot is composed of two symmetrical flywheel mechanisms with cameras mounted on both sides. In this project, I focused on the panoramic stitching technique under binocular vision and the target detection technique under `HSV` color space. Following figures show the `3D design` and prototype of the robot.
